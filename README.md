# Simple timeline from CSV file

This is a quick and dirty demonstration of how to create a timeline from a CSV file. 

## How to create your own timeline from CSV in github

1) Sign-up for a Github account (above right)

2) Come back to here

3) Press the fork button (top right)

4) Add your data

4a) You can edit data.csv directly by pressing the pencil icon after you click data.csv in Github

or  

4b) You can download the file and edit it in a spreadsheet application and then upload it as a new csv file using add file in github, if you do this you will need to edit js/load.js to point at your new csv file. Change the name of the file in the top two lines of load.js to your new file name, it is case sensitive! You MUST KEEP the same structure and column titles. You can add columns but these won't do much.

then

5) Save your new data by clicking commit changes

6) Browse to your timeline at http://{github-username}.github.io/timeline (where you put in your github username)

MAGIC!
