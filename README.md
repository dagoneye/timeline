# Simple timeline from CSV file

This is a quick and dirty demonstration of how to create a timeline from a CSV file. 

## How to create your own timeline from CSV in github

1) Sign-up for a Github account (above right)

2) Come back to here

3) Press the fork button (top right)

4) Edit data.csv (either directly or in a spreadsheet which you then export as a CSV to overwrite this file). YOU MUST KEEP THE SAME COLUMN TITLES.

5) Save your new data by clicking commit changes

MAGIC!
